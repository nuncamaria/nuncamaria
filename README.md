## About me 👀

After 3 years working as a graphic designer and with the desire to explore a more diversified and technology-related path, I got into Front-End development. First I obtained experience in web development and afterwards in mobile with Android native, which is what I am currently working with as of this moment.

- 📚 I did a <b>Front-end Development</b> Bootcamp (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React)

- 🤖 Self-taught Android developer (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose & XML, MVVM, Flows)

- 🌱 Right now working as a <b>Android Developer</b>
